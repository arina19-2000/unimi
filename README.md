M.Sc. in Data Scince for Economics, UniMi:

- üéµ[Spotify songs popularity](https://github.com/arina19-2000/ridgeregression): this Python project analyses the Spotify dataset to assess the impact of various features on the song popularity, using a custom Ridge Regression implementation (without scikit-learn libraries or similar).
- ‚öïÔ∏è [Autism diagnosing](https://github.com/arina19-2000/unimi/tree/main/Autism%20diagnosing): this R project aims to define the main socio-demographic and medical features which might be linked to being diagnosed with autism.

B.A. in Global Governance, UniRoma2:
- üñäÔ∏è [B.A. thesis paper](https://github.com/arina19-2000/unimi/tree/main/B.A.%20thesis): this study looks into the recent state of youth unemployment in Italy using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) to deploy various ML tools in R (different types of regression analysis, decision trees, and random forest). The primary research question concerns the explanation behind the disparity in unemployment rates: do social factors such as respondents' age, gender, education, parental background, and country of origin significantly affect their chances of gaining employment? This research is meaningful not only because it would be a useful read for recent Italian university graduates who are about to enter the labor force, but the topics of socio-demographic analysis of Italian youth and their ability to gain employment are rather overlooked, so the paper adds value to the variety of social research, as the subject of unemployment is oftentimes addressed strictly from the economic perspective.
